• Drag the table down and release to clear the list of found peripherals and begin scanning

• Tap a row in the table to view a peripheral's advertisement data.

• Each peripheral's Received Signal Strength (RSSI) is displayed to the left of its name.

• Tap a row's connect button to connect the corresponding device in one of the available modes:

Info - displays peripheral services & characteristics

UART - basic terminal, send & receive data 

Pin I/O - uses Bluefruit's UART to control Arduino running BLEFirmata sketch:
